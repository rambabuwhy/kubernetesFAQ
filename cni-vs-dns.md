# CNI vs DNS

Container Network Interface (CNI) and Domain Name System (DNS) in the context of Kubernetes:

1. **Container Network Interface (CNI):**
   * The Container Network Interface (CNI) is responsible for configuring networking for containers in a Kubernetes cluster. It handles tasks such as assigning IP addresses, creating network namespaces, setting up network routes, and implementing network policies.
   * CNI plugins are responsible for implementing these network configurations. They ensure that containers within Kubernetes pods can communicate with each other, with services, and with external resources. CNI plugins typically operate at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) of the OSI model.
2. **Domain Name System (DNS):**
   * The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system used to translate human-readable domain names (like [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers can understand. In the context of Kubernetes, DNS is used for service discovery.
   * Kubernetes has an integrated DNS service, typically provided by CoreDNS or kube-dns. This service allows pods within a Kubernetes cluster to discover and communicate with each other using domain names rather than IP addresses.
   * Kubernetes DNS resolves service names to IP addresses, allowing pods to communicate with each other across the cluster. It operates at Layer 7 (Application) of the OSI model.

In summary, while both CNI and DNS are essential components of a Kubernetes cluster, they serve different purposes:

* CNI manages the networking configuration and connectivity between pods and services within the cluster at lower network layers (Layer 3 and Layer 4).
* DNS facilitates service discovery within the cluster by translating service names to IP addresses at the application layer (Layer 7), enabling communication between pods using human-readable domain names.
