# Taints and tolerations

Taints and tolerations are mechanisms in Kubernetes that allow you to control which nodes can run particular pods.

Taints are applied to nodes, and they repel certain pods from being scheduled onto those nodes unless the pods have corresponding tolerations. Tolerations, on the other hand, are specified within pod specifications, allowing pods to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints.

Here's an example of how kubelet taints can be used:

1. **Scenario**: You have a set of nodes in your Kubernetes cluster that are designated for specific types of workloads, such as high-performance computing (HPC) jobs. These nodes are optimized for CPU-intensive tasks.
2. **Objective**: You want to ensure that only pods specifically designed for CPU-intensive tasks are scheduled on these nodes.
3.  **Implementation**:

    * First, you would apply a taint to the nodes intended for CPU-intensive tasks. This taint effectively repels pods that don't specify a corresponding toleration.
    *   You could apply a taint like this to the nodes:

        ```arduino
        kubectl taint nodes <node-name> cpu-intensive=true:NoSchedule
        ```

        This command adds a taint named `cpu-intensive` with the value `true` to the specified node(s), and `NoSchedule` indicates that pods without a matching toleration won't be scheduled on these nodes.

        To apply a taint to a node using the `kubectl` command-line tool, you can use the following syntax:

        ```bash
        kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
        ```

        Where:

        * `<node-name>` is the name of the node to taint.
        * `<key>` is the key for the taint.
        * `<value>` is the value for the taint.
        * `<effect>` is the effect of the taint, which can be one of `NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, or `NoExecute`. `NoSchedule` means that no new pods will be scheduled on the node, `PreferNoSchedule` means that the scheduler will try to avoid placing new pods on the node but will not prevent it entirely, and `NoExecute` means that existing pods on the node that do not tolerate the taint will be evicted.



    *   Next, in the pod specification for your CPU-intensive workload, you would add a toleration to allow scheduling on nodes with the `cpu-intensive` taint:

        ```yaml
        tolerations:
        - key: "cpu-intensive"
          operator: "Equal"
          value: "true"
          effect: "NoSchedule"
        ```

        This tells Kubernetes that the pod tolerates the `cpu-intensive` taint with the value `true` and allows it to be scheduled on nodes with that taint.
4. **Result**: Pods that have the toleration for the `cpu-intensive` taint will be scheduled on nodes with that taint. Pods without the toleration won't be scheduled on those nodes, ensuring that only CPU-intensive workloads run on the designated nodes.

In summary, kubelet taints are a powerful feature in Kubernetes for controlling pod placement based on node characteristics, allowing for better resource utilization and workload isolation within the cluster.
