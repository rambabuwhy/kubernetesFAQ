# Pod networking

\
When a pod is created in Kubernetes, the responsibility of assigning an IP address to it falls on the Kubernetes networking plugin. Kubernetes supports multiple networking plugins, such as Flannel, Calico, Weave, and others. Each plugin may have its own mechanism for assigning IP addresses to pods.

\
The Container Networking Interface (CNI) is indeed a standard for network plugins in Kubernetes. CNI plugins are responsible for setting up networking for pods, including IP address assignment. Calico is one such CNI plugin commonly used in Kubernetes clusters.

However, the common pattern involves the following steps:

1. **Pod Creation**: When a pod is created, the Kubernetes API server receives the request.
2. **Scheduler Assignment**: The Kubernetes scheduler selects a node for the pod to run on.
3. **CNI Plugin Invocation**: Once the pod is scheduled to a node, Kubernetes invokes the CNI plugin configured for the cluster.
4. **IP Address Assignment**: The CNI plugin, such as Calico, is responsible for assigning an IP address to the pod. Calico typically assigns IP addresses using its own IP address management (IPAM) mechanism.
5. **Pod Initialization**: After the IP address is assigned, the pod's containers are initialized and started. The pod is then ready to accept traffic.

So, to clarify, CNI plugins like Calico are indeed responsible for IP address assignment within Kubernetes clusters, working in conjunction with Kubernetes rather than as separate entities. Thank you for bringing up this point for clarification.

It's important to note that the specific details of IP address assignment may vary depending on the networking plugin and the configuration of the Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, newer features and plugins may introduce different approaches to networking and IP address assignment.
