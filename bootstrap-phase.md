# Bootstrap phase

In Kubernetes, the bootstrap phase refers to the initial setup and configuration process that nodes (machines) go through to join the cluster. This phase is crucial for establishing trust between the node and the Kubernetes control plane, ensuring that the node is authorized to join the cluster and perform its designated roles.

The bootstrap phase typically involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: The node is prepared for joining the Kubernetes cluster. This may include installing necessary software components such as the kubelet, container runtime (e.g., Docker), and any required dependencies.
2. **Authentication**: During the bootstrap phase, the node needs to authenticate itself to the Kubernetes control plane. This is often done using a bootstrap token, which is a temporary authentication mechanism specifically designed for nodes joining the cluster. The token is generated securely and provides the node with the necessary credentials to communicate with the control plane.
3. **Authorization**: Once authenticated, the Kubernetes control plane verifies whether the node is authorized to join the cluster. Authorization checks may include ensuring that the node's identity and credentials match those expected by the cluster, and that the node has permissions to perform its designated roles within the cluster.
4. **Configuration**: After successful authentication and authorization, the node is configured with the necessary parameters to communicate with the rest of the cluster. This includes setting up networking, obtaining necessary certificates and keys, and establishing connections with the Kubernetes API server and other components.
5. **Registration**: Finally, the node registers itself with the Kubernetes control plane, indicating its readiness to participate in the cluster. This registration process typically involves sending information about the node's capabilities, such as available resources and architectural details, to the control plane.

Once the bootstrap phase is complete, the node is fully integrated into the Kubernetes cluster and can begin running pods and participating in cluster operations. The bootstrap process is typically automated to streamline cluster deployment and ensure consistent configuration across nodes.
